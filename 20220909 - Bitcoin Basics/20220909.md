Dan is speaking at a conference in London, Panel 6C
[Schedule](https://financeandsocietynetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/intersections-2022-fullprog.pdf)

Dan was also on a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1GsFbKDteU), discussed financial plumbing, fed, defi, crypto

A Soon Parted post about Proof of Work/Stake: [blog](https://www.soonparted.co/p/proof-of).

And some old videos Dan's professor made, a semester's class about Economics of Money and Banking [here](https://sites.bu.edu/perry/mb-lectures/). He knows this topic better than anyone, this is the right explanation.

Nur- technical/cultural Bitcoin elements
0. Hashes- one way functions, easy to compute input -> output, very difficult to get output -> input. The basis for proof in bitcoin.
1. Public/Private keys- encrypt with public key, decrypt with private.
2. Coins
3. Chains of blocks- previous block signs the next, guessing which

4. It's more profitable to participate than undermine the chain
5. It's unlikely that a 51% attack will be successful because an attacker would need to catch up with the existing chain.

Jackson- social elements
The current system is dominated by "trusted third parties"- banks. Slows down, increases min transaction costs, etc. Bitcoin acts completely on its own.

"Justice equals CPU power"- what allows people to mint BTC is the computing power they commit to it.

The only arbitration you get is that which is programmed into the system.

Fundamental flaw of commerce is a trust based model- buyers and sellers must be skeptical. Fraud is always a given. Trust is a bad word. Nakamoto holds that trust creates room for error.

Critiques of this white paper:
This system doesn't prevent fraud beyond manipulation of the system itself. Trust is still needed amongst transactors.

Trust-based model feels more like ideology, Nakamoto has valid concerns but fixes problems that don't exist (Merchant's Paranoia). This is a philosophical problem, not a banking problem.

**Obvious** power imbalance wherein printing money (having compute) lets you print more money (buy more compute). The system creates a hierarchy and is questionably sustainable.

There's a difference betweek cryptography and cryptocurrency- akin to saying a house fell over because the bricks were bad.

RE wealth inequality- mining operations dominate
RE fraud-proof systems- banks and institutions have been trying to build "foolproof systems" for many years. Rules will find a way to be broken. You need both a changing system and a stable system- can this be enforced? Jackson says the kind of dynamism needed for fraud prevention can only come from a human being.

Society is reliant on trust- a monetary system based on lack of trust is basically sociopathic.

A hacker's conception of trust is very different from a social scientist's- trust to a hacker is about proving an interaction will go according to plan, rather than good for everone.

Crypto is based on blockchain but how do we build on the blockchain? How do we see what's happening on the blockchain?
